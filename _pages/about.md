# <font color="#2B6ADD" > Intro </font>
<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: Roboto;">
I am currently a Professor in Intelligent Media Analysis Group (<a href="https://imag-njust.net">IMAG</a>), 
		at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China. 
		From Mar. 2023 to Apr. 2025, I was an Assistant Researcher of Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University 
		and working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W-FGd_UAAAAJ&hl=en">Tieniu Tan</a>.
		I obtained Ph.D. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technolog, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://imag-njust.net/jinhui-tang">Jinhui Tang</a>, in Nov. 2022. 
		From Jan. 2022 to Aug. 2022, I worked as a Research Intern (Part-time) at ByteDance. 
		From Sep. 2021 to Dec. 2021, I worked as a Research Intern (Part-time) at Tencent with <a href="https://geyixiao.com/">Yixiao Ge</a>. 
		From Dec. 2018 to Dec. 2019, I worked as a Research Intern at <a href="http://www.noahlab.com.hk/">HUAWEI NOAH'S ARK LAB</a> with <a href="http://lingxixie.com/Home.html">Lingxi Xie</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=61b6eYkAAAAJ&hl=en">Qi Tian</a> (IEEE Fellow). 
		I am working closely with <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~zs2262/">Mike Shou</a> and <a href="https://imag-njust.net/xiangboshu">Xiangbo Shu</a>. 
		My research mainly focus on Video Understanding and Multimodal Understanding.
